Andhra Pradesh Academy of Sciences (APAS) was established in the
undivided state of Andhra Pradesh in the year, 1963, for promoting
scientific knowledge including practical application to problems of the
State welfare. APAS has been rechristened as "Telangana Academy of
Sciences (TAS)" after the formation of the Telangana State.
TAS has been actively involved in disseminating scientific knowledge
to the society through its activities by organizing meets, discussions,
seminars, conferences and symposia and bringing out books and
publications of popular science. The Academy takes forward scientific
creative activity through education, research and discovery by
identification and nurturing of scientific talent among the young.
As part of its major flagship activities, the TAS is holding first ever
nd th Telangana State Science Congress (TSSC-2018) during 22 -24
December, 2018 in association with the National Institute of
Technology (NIT) Warangal as part of the latter's Diamond Jubilee
st Celebrations. The event also marks the 131 Birth Anniversary of the
nd Indian Mathematical prodigal genius, Sir Srinivasa Ramanujan (22
December, 1887), Which is observed, every year, as "National
Mathematics Day". This event is mainly aimed at promoting
interaction among the scientific community across various disciplines
at National and International level, besides popularizing science
among the teachers and students.
The TSSC-2018 will have scientific sessions on SEVEN major themes on
Science and Technology besides some special sessions.
Telangana Academy of Sciences has been working relentlessly to
promote scientific temper in Telangana State. It has been recognizing
eminent scientists / Professors and electing them to the fellowship of
the Academy. TAS also promotes children science activities,
encourages young scientists towards inventions, investigations and
research in pursuit of excellence in the fields of Science and
Technology. Its activities include organizing endowment lectures,
seminars, symposia, popular exhibitions and programs on overall
perception of science and society.
For the last 55 years, the activities of the Academy have immensely
helped in sharing the academic scholarship among its Fellows and
Associate Fellows, in particular and the scientific community, in
general. They have also catalyzed popularization of science and
inculcation of scientific temper among children and general public.
The Academy, in a bid to reach the wider community and to extend its
activities, has established Five Regional Centers at Nizamabad,
Karimnagar, Hyderabad, Nalgonda and Warangal covering all the
Districts of Telangana State.
The Focal theme for the Telangana State Science Congress-2018 is
"Science & Technology for an All Round and Sustainable
Development of the Telangana State". The State of Telangana is the
th nd youngest and the 29 State in India. It has been formed on 2 June,
2014 through the AP Reorganization Act. Being an infantile federal
state with rich cultural heritage and abundant natural and human
resources but low industrial and literacy, the State of Telangana is
poised to leap into an all round and sustainable development.
Sustainable development addresses the socio-economic
development catalysed by scientific, technological and industrial
advances. The proactive cooperation and positive support of the
scientific community would augment and empower the Government
for a sustainable development of the Telangana State. The
development of the State is intertwined with the advancements in
Science and Technology in different fields, namely, cleaner & fuel
efficient technogies, de-fluoridation of drinking water, solar energy
harnessing housing technology, entrepreneurship development,
human health, water resources, information technology,
biotechnology, sustainable human resource management, etc. The
TSSC-2018 will identify the key areas in the activities of planning for an
all round and sustainable development of the Telangana State.

About the Warangal City
The National Institute of Technology Warangal (NITW), formerly
known as the Regional Engineering College Warangal, is the first
among the chain of 31 NITs crowned as Institutes of National
Importance. It was established by an Act of Parliament. The country's
first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone
th th on 10 October, 1959 for this Institute. Thus, 10 October, 2018 marks
the commencement of the of NITW.
The Institute presently offers 8 B.Tech Programmes in Engineering, 25
M.Tech Programmes and 7 other Postgraduate Programmes (M.Sc.,
M.Sc (Tech)., MCA and MBA) and PhD Programmes in all the thirteen
Departments including Engineering, Sciences, Humanities,
Management and Physical Education. The institute is well-known for
its Research and Development, state of the art laboratories, Industrial
consultancy, Continuing Education Programmes for teachers and
industrial personnel.
The World Bank supports the Institute through Technical Education
Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) and currently Phase III is in
progress. The MHRD has recognized NITW as one of the six E&ICT
Academies in the country. NITW also hosts scores of advanced shortterm
training courses conducted by International academicians under
the MHRD's Global Initiative for Academic Network (GIAN)
Programme.
The institute has about 600 foreign students from as many as 40
countries. It has strong academic and research collaborations with
several leading foreign universities and through programs like
HERITAGE, EUPHRATES, HORIZON-2020, etc. Students and faculty avail
themselves of several short-term international exchange and mobility
programs through these channels.
The Institute is recognized by the MHRD to run a Teaching Learning
Centre (TLC) for Higher Education and is recognized as a National
Resource Centre (NRC) in Mathematics under the Pandit Madan
Mohan Malaviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching
(PMMMNMTT). The MHRD has also recognized NIT Warangal as a
Mentoring Institute under its very proactive mission, the Rasthtriya
Avishkar Abhyan (RAA) to mentor the school science education in the
